      I investigated the ZenQuotes API but got a CORS error, so though it was
      wise to abandon it. This is because resources list we were given avoided
      API's that used CORS.
      <a
        href="https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources"
        target="_blank"
        >Resources List</a
      >
    </p>

      So I found another quotes API, which happened to have other API's too. You
      can view in console what each returns. The QR code unfortunately can't be
      viwed in console, but can be tested at this address:
      <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/api/qrcode" target="_blank"
        >https://api-ninjas.com/api/qrcode</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I typed in Shirley and it created a QR code. I read the QR image created
      with the camera on my phone and it said "Shirley".

      I chose 3 so we have options, yet we can choose any others from the list.
